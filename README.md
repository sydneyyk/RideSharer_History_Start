# RideSharer_History_Start
## Task3 Swift - Add a Ride History List

> **Set Up** 
> Before you tackle this task, you will need to download and install **Xcode** from the Mac App store.
>
> **Instructions**
>
> 1. Open the `RideSharer.xcodeproj` file in the `RideSharer_Map_Start` folder.
>
>
> 2. Add a map to the view. Use constraints to make it cover the entire view, like you did with the ride history table view, and similarly create an **IBOutlet** for it.
>
>
> 3. Get the user's current location and display it on the map.
>
>
> 4. If the user denies location access, show an alert telling the user that they have not provided permission.
>
>
> 5. Run the app and ensure the location request is displayed. Allow the request and see that your location is showing on the map. Reset the location permissions by removing the app, then re-running it. This time, deny permission to track your location. Run the app again and see that the alert is displayed.
>
>
> 6. Create a git repository and upload your project to Github.
>    If you haven't already, create an account at [https://github.com](https://github.com/). 
>
>    Download and open [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), and log in with your account.
>
>    In Github Desktop, select File > Add Local Repository. Choose the directory of the project you've been building. You'll see a warning, since a git repository hasn't been created yet for the project. Click the "create a repository" text.
>
>    On the next screen enter a name for the repository, or keep the default. The other options you can ignore for now. Click Create Repository.
>
>    An initial commit should have been created automatically. You can now click Publish repository at the top of the window. This will push your code to Github.
>
>    In the Github Desktop top menu, select Repository > View on Github.
